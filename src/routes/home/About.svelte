    Hello, I am a creative from Seattle, WA. I dabble in a lot of hobbies such as working on old cars, writing music, photography, and of course, developing and designing websites. I have been in the front end development industry for 5 years now and I have had the amazing privillege of building websites for large brands like Microsoft, SONY and VMware. I am always keeping myself busy with building web apps for practice or teaching myself something new and diving into latest JavaScript frameworks and technoliogies.
